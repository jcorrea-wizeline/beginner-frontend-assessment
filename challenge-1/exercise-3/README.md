# Exercise 3

Given an array of numbers, create a function that returns the [mode](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)>).

Scenarios:

- If the mode exists, return it inside of an array.
- If there are more than one mode, return them on an array.
- If there is not a mode, return empty array.

Please follow the scenarios on the `exercise-3-follow-the-mode.js` file.

**Example:**

Given the array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return the array `[1]` because it's the number that is more repeated on the array.

Given the array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5]`, the function will return the array `[1, 2]` because are the numbers that are more repeated on the array.

Given the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will return the empty array `[]` because are the numbers that are more repeated on the array.

**Restrictions:**

N/A.
