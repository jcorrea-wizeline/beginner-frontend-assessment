# Challenge 3 - Website development (HTML5, CSS3, JS)

For this challenge you will work using [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).

Codesandbox is an awesome web development tool where we can create frontend projects and execute them on live.

### Deliverable

Please send us the URL of your sandbox solution for this challenge.

### Criteria Acceptance (AC)

- When the user fills the inputs and clicks on `send` button, the form should send a JS alert (`window.alert`) with the values of the inputs as an object. Example: `{name: 'john doe', age: 25, favoriteProgrammingLanguage: 'JS'}`
- When the form is empty and the user clicks on `send` button, the form should show the message validations as `The name is required`, `The age is required` and `The favorite programming language` at the top of the form.

### Evaluation

- First AC: `50`.
- Second AC: `50`.

**Bonus**

- If the user focus an element from the form and leaves it without a value, the form should show a message that a value is required (the validations on submit are still required): `20`.
- Add free styles to the page: `20`.

Max Total: `140`.
